# binary-search-tree
A program reads numbers from the input and creates a binary search tree (BST). 
Then you can execute multiple operations on the created BST: 
  1. Searching for the smallest and largest value in the tree and printing the search path 
  2. Printing all BST elements in ascending order (in - order algorithm) 
  3. Printing all BST elements in pre-order 
  4. Printig out the subtree in pre-order whose root (key) is given by the user 
  5. Balancing the BST by rotation (DSW algorithm) 
  6. Deleting a BST element given by the user 
  7. Deleting the entire BST element by element with the post-order method
An example of input line is presented in the file 'numbers.txt'.
